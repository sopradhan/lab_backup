1.Introduction
AI is redefining how we operate and use technology to create business value. The 
potential of AI is all encompassing: AI will solve business problems and create new 
opportunities, transforming how we deliver services to our customers. These are 
exciting times and each one of us should contribute with our ideas and expertise to 
realize the potential of AI. tcsAI (to be read as 'TCS to the power of AI') is bringing AI 
closer to you through AI/GenAI hackathons and in-person labs (AI Fridays) at branch 
level. It is an intensive, innovation-driven event where participants come together to 
solve real-world problems using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over a 
limited time frame, teams will design, build, and present AI-powered solutions across 
various domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, finance, sustainability, and more.
2.Purpose
This handbook will guide you through everything you need to know to make the most 
of your hackathon experience. It also outlines the roles, responsibilities, protocols, 
models, FAQs for participants. Provide resources and references to ensure success.
3.Scope
This handbook applies to all participants involved in the AI Friday event.
4.Overview
Here is the overview of the complete process at high level. The participant journey in 
the AI Friday is designed to provide structured engagement, enabling participants to
effectively collaborate, experiment on real world use case and enriching their own 
learning experience. If you encounter any issues, please contact your branch SPOC 
listed in the Annexure. Refer: 13.8

5.Eligibility and Registration
This section outlines eligibility requirements and registration process.
5.1. Who Can Participate
• Open to all associates who have a passion for AI/ML, data science, or 
problem-solving
• Pre-requisite - Basic knowledge of Python and LLM is needed. If you lack 
knowledge in these areas and wish to upskill, please refer to the courses 
listed in the section. Refer: 13.9
• Participants can join as individuals or form a team of 5 members, out of 
which minimum 2 associates should be of Grades C1 or below
5.2. Registration Process
• Complete the online registration form at this link - Nomination Form
• Specifying whether you are nominating a team or registering as an individual.
• If you are nominating as a team, please include your team’s name, team 
members’ Employee IDs, your years of experience, preferred date for 
participation (one of the Friday’s listed), BG Name, TCS Office location, skill 
set, mobile number with consent, T-shirt size. Please be aware of this date is 
a preference and your Branch SPOC will confirm the same.
• For team nominations, ensure that each team member fills out the form 
separately and refer the same team’s name and team member employee id’s. 
Mismatch in this will lead to not having the preferred team members. 
6.Team Formation
Teams should be diverse in skills and experience, promoting learning and 
collaboration. Balanced teams often lead to better, well-rounded solutions
Guidelines:
• Team size: 5 members out of which minimum 2 associates should be of 
Grades C1 or below
• Teams can be self-formed before the event, and all members should mention 
the same team’s name while registering as mentioned in section 5.2
• For individual nominations, teams will be randomly formed using AI
